1. You are given a partially written LinkedList class.
2. You are required to complete the body of findIntersection function. The function is passed two linked lists which start separately but merge at a node and become common thereafter. The function is expected to find the point where two linked lists merge. You are not allowed to use arrays to solve the problem.
3. Input and Output is managed for you. 



    public static int findIntersection(LinkedList one, LinkedList two){
      // write your code here
      Node onenode=one.head;
      Node twonode=two.head;
      int count=Math.abs(one.size()-two.size());
      if(one.size()>two.size()){
          for(int i=0;i<count;i++){
              onenode=onenode.next;
          }
      }
      else{
            for(int i=0;i<count;i++){
              twonode=twonode.next;
          }
      }
      
      while(onenode!=twonode){
          onenode=onenode.next;
          twonode=twonode.next;
      }
      
      return onenode.data;
    }
  }
